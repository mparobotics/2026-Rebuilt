Figure 5-4 Areas, markings, and zones 
 
− ALLIANCE AREA: an approximately 360in wide by 134in deep (~9.14m by 3.4m) infinitely tall volume 
formed by, and including the ALLIANCE WALL, OUTPOST, TOWER WALL, the edge of the carpet, and 
ALLIANCE colored tape perpendicular to the DRIVER STATIONS. 
− ALLIANCE ZONE: A 158.6in deep by 317.7in long (~4.03m by 8.07m), infinitely tall volume formed by an 
ALLIANCE WALL, TOWER WALL, and guardrails. It surrounds an ALLIANCE TOWER and a DEPOT. It is 
bounded by and includes the ROBOT STARTING LINE. 
− CENTER LINE: a white line that spans the width of the FIELD that bisects the NEUTRAL ZONE in half.  
− NEUTRAL ZONE: A 283in deep by 317.7in long (7.19m by 8.07m), infinitely tall volume formed by the 
BUMPS, TRENCHES, HUBS, and guardrails. It surrounds and includes the CENTER LINE. 
− HUMAN STARTING LINE: a white line spanning the ALLIANCE AREA up to the OUTPOST AREA that is 
parallel to and located 24.0in (61.0cm) from the bottom square tube of the ALLIANCE WALL to the near 
edge of the tape. 
− OUTPOST AREA: a 71.0in wide by 134in deep (1.8m by 3.4m) infinitely tall volume bounded by the 
OUTPOST, edge of carpet, and ALLIANCE and white colored tape.  
− ROBOT STARTING LINE: an ALLIANCE colored line that spans the width of the FIELD at the edge of an 
ALLIANCE’S BASE in front of two BARRIERS and an ALLIANCE HUB.

5.4 HUB 
Figure 5-5 HUB 
 
A HUB is one of two 47in by 47in (~1.19m by 1.19m) rectangular prism structures with an extended opening at 
the top surface. Each ALLIANCE has a dedicated HUB centered between two BUMPS located 158.6in (~4.03m) 
away from their ALLIANCE WALL. Each HUB has a set of exits that randomly distributes FUEL into the 
NEUTRAL ZONE. A net structure located in the back of the HUB prevents FUEL launched from most prohibited 
areas from entering the opening.

The top of each HUB has a 41.7in (~1.06m) hexagonal opening into which ROBOTS can deliver FUEL. The front 
edge of the opening is 72in (~1.83m) off the carpet. 
Figure 5-7: HUB Dimensions 
   
HUBS have a series of exits at the base of the HUB facing towards the NEUTRAL ZONE. FUEL processed 
through the HUB are distributed into the NEUTRAL ZONE via one of four exits as shown in Figure 5-8. Examples 
of FUEL distribution from the HUB can be found on the Playing FIELD webpage.

The top angles of the HUB are lit by DMX light bars that indicate if the HUB is active. See Table 5-3 for more 
details about the various light states in the HUB.

Figure 5-9 BUMP 
 
BUMPS are 73.0in (1.854m) wide, 44.4in (1.128m) deep, and 6.513in (16.54cm) tall structures on either side of 
the HUB that ROBOTS drive over. The top surface of each BUMP is made up of 0.5in (1.27cm) thick, ALLIANCE 
colored, Orange Peel textured, HDPE ramps at a 15-degree angle with one ramp sloping down towards the 
NEUTRAL ZONE and the other ramp sloping down towards the ALLIANCE ZONE.
