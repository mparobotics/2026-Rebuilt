G427 The OUTPOST has a storage limit. Off-FIELD FUEL may only be stored in the CHUTE and the CORRAL. 
Excess FUEL, defined as the CHUTE & CORRAL being full, must immediately be entered onto the FIELD. 
HUMAN PLAYERS making a good-faith effort to immediately move or enter additional FUEL is an 
exception to this rule.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL, and if CONTINUOUS, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed. 
7.5 Post-MATCH 
G501 *Leave promptly. A DRIVE TEAM member may not cause significant or multiple delays to the start of a 
subsequent MATCH, scheduled break content, or other FIELD activities. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations at any point during the event.

Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 71 of 162 
8 ROBOT  Construction Rules  (R)  
The rules listed below explicitly address legal parts and materials and how those parts and materials may be 
used on a REBUILT ROBOT. A ROBOT is an electromechanical assembly built by the FIRST Robotics 
Competition team to play the current season’s game and includes all the basic systems required to be an 
active participant in the game –power, communications, control, BUMPERS, and movement about the FIELD. A 
BUMPER is a protective assembly designed to attach to the exterior of the ROBOT and constructed as 
specified in section 8.4 BUMPER Rules. 
There are many reasons for the structure of the rules, including safety, reliability, parity, creation of a 
reasonable design challenge, adherence to professional standards, impact on the competition, and 
compatibility with the Kit of Parts (KOP). The KOP is the collection of items listed on the current season’s 
Kickoff Kit Checklists, distributed to the team via FIRST Choice in the current season, or paid for completely 
(except shipping) with a Product Donation Voucher (PDV) from the current season.  
Another intent of these rules is to have all energy sources and active actuation systems on the ROBOT (e.g. 
batteries, compressors, motors, servos, cylinders, and their controllers) drawn from a well-defined set of 
options. This is to ensure that all teams have access to the same actuation resources and that the 
INSPECTORS are able to accurately and efficiently assess the legality of a given part. 
ROBOTS are made up of COMPONENTS and MECHANISMS. A COMPONENT is any part in its most basic 
configuration, which cannot be disassembled without damaging or destroying the part or altering its 
fundamental function. A MECHANISM is an assembly of COMPONENTS that provide specific functionality on 
the ROBOT. A MECHANISM can be disassembled (and then reassembled) into individual COMPONENTS 
without damage to the parts. 
Many rules in this section reference Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items. A COTS item must be a standard 
(i.e. not custom order) part commonly available from a VENDOR for all teams for purchase. To be a COTS item, 
the COMPONENT or MECHANISM must be in an unaltered, unmodified state (with the exception of installation 
or modification of any software). Items that are no longer commercially available but are functionally 
equivalent to the original condition as delivered from the VENDOR are considered COTS and may be used. 
Example 1: A team orders 2 ROBOT grippers from RoboHands Corp. and receives 
both items. They put 1 in their storeroom and plan to use it later. Into the other, 
they drill “lightening holes” to reduce weight. The first gripper is still classified as 
a COTS item, but the second gripper is now a FABRICATED ITEM, as it has been 
modified. 
Example 2: A team obtains openly available blueprints of a drive module 
commonly available from Wheels-R-Us Inc. and has local machine shop “We-
Make-It, Inc.” manufacture a copy of the part for them. The produced part is not a 
COTS item, because it is not commonly carried as part of the standard stock of 
We-Make-It, Inc. 
Example 3: A team obtains openly available design drawings from a professional 
publication during the pre-season and uses them to fabricate a gearbox for their 
ROBOT during the build period following Kickoff. The design drawings are

Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 72 of 162 
considered a COTS item and may be used as “raw material” to fabricate the 
gearbox. The finished gearbox itself would be a FABRICATED ITEM, and not a 
COTS item. 
Example 4: A COTS part that has non-functional label markings added would still 
be considered a COTS part, but a COTS part that has device-specific mounting 
holes added is a FABRICATED ITEM. 
Example 5: A team has a COTS single-board processor version 1.0, which can no 
longer be purchased. Only the COTS single-board processor version 2.0 may be 
purchased. If the COTS single-board processor version 1.0 is functionally 
equivalent to its original condition, it may be used. 
Example 6: A team has a COTS gearbox which has been discontinued. If the 
COTS gearbox is functionally equivalent to its original condition, it may be used. 
A VENDOR is a legitimate business source for COTS items that satisfies all the following criteria: 
A. has a Federal Tax Identification number. In cases where the VENDOR is outside of the United States, 
they must possess an equivalent form of registration or license with the government of their home 
nation that establishes and validates their status as a legitimate business licensed to operate within 
that country. 
B. is not a “wholly owned subsidiary” of a FIRST Robotics Competition team or collection of teams. While 
there may be some individuals affiliated with both a team and the VENDOR, the business and activities 
of the team and VENDOR must be completely separable. 
C. should maintain sufficient stock or production capability so they are able to ship any general (i.e., non-
FIRST unique) product within 5 business days of receiving a valid purchase request. It is recognized 
that certain unusual circumstances (such as such as a global supply chain disruption and/or 1,000 
FIRST teams all ordering the same part at once from the same VENDOR) may cause atypical delays in 
shipping due to backorders for even the largest VENDORS. Such delays due to higher-than-normal order 
rates are excused. This criterion may not apply to custom-built items from a source that is both a 
VENDOR and a fabricator. 
For example, a VENDOR may sell flexible belting that the team wishes to procure 
to use as treads on their drive system. The VENDOR cuts the belting to a custom 
length from standard shelf stock that is typically available, welds it into a loop to 
make a tread, and ships it to a team. The fabrication of the tread takes the 
VENDOR 2 weeks. This would be considered a FABRICATED ITEM, and the 2-
week ship time is acceptable. Alternately, the team may decide to fabricate the 
treads themselves. To satisfy this criterion, the VENDOR would just have to ship 
a length of belting from shelf stock (i.e. a COTS item) to the team within 5 
business days and leave the welding of the cuts to the team. 
D. makes their products available to all FIRST Robotics Competition teams. A VENDOR must not limit 
supply or make a product available to just a limited number of FIRST Robotics Competition teams. 
The intent of this definition is to be as inclusive as possible to permit access to 
all legitimate sources, while preventing ad hoc organizations from providing 

---


## Page 73

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 73 of 162 
special-purpose products to a limited subset of teams in an attempt to 
circumvent the cost accounting rules.  
FIRST desires to permit teams to have the broadest choice of legitimate sources 
possible, and to obtain COTS items from the sources that provide them with the 
best prices and level of service available. Teams also need to protect against 
long delays in availability of parts that will impact their ability to complete their 
ROBOT. The build season is brief, so the VENDOR must be able to get their 
product, particularly FIRST unique items, to a team in a timely manner.  
Ideally, chosen VENDORS should have national distributors (e.g. Home Depot, 
Lowes, MSC, McMaster-Carr, etc.). Remember, FIRST Robotics Competition 
events are not always near home – when parts fail, local access to replacement 
materials is often critical. 
A FABRICATED ITEM is any COMPONENT or MECHANISM that has been altered, built, cast, constructed, 
concocted, created, cut, heat treated, machined, manufactured, modified, painted, produced, surface coated, or 
conjured partially or completely into the final form in which it will be used on the ROBOT. 
Note that it is possible for an item (typically raw materials) to be neither COTS 
nor a FABRICATED ITEM. For example, a 120.0in (3.048m) length of aluminum 
which has been cut into 60.0in (1.52m) pieces by the team for storage or 
transport is neither COTS (it’s not in the state received from the VENDOR), nor a 
FABRICATED ITEM (the cuts were not made to advance the part towards its final 
form on the ROBOT). 
Teams may be asked to provide documentation proving the legality of non-REBUILT KOP items during 
inspection where a rule specifies limits for a legal part (e.g. pneumatic items, current limits, COTS electronics, 
etc.). 
Some of these rules make use of English unit requirements for parts. If your team has a question about a 
metric-equivalent part’s legality, please e-mail your question to the FIRST Robotics Competition Kit of Parts 
team at frcparts@firstinspires.org for an official ruling. To seek approval for alternate devices for inclusion in 
future FIRST Robotics Competition seasons, please contact the Kit of Parts team at frcparts@firstinspires.org 
with item specifications. 
Teams should acknowledge the support provided by the corporate sponsors and mentors with an appropriate 
display of their school and sponsors names and/or logos (or the name of the supporting youth organization, if 
appropriate). 
FIRST Robotics Competition can be a full-contact competition and may include rigorous game play. While the 
rules aim to limit severe damage to ROBOTS, teams should design their ROBOTS to be robust.

Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 74 of 162 
8.1 General ROBOT Design 
R101 *ROBOT PERIMETER must be fixed. The ROBOT (excluding BUMPERS) must have a ROBOT 
PERIMETER, contained within the BUMPER ZONE and established while in the ROBOT’S STARTING 
CONFIGURATION, that is comprised of fixed, non-articulated structural elements of the ROBOT. Minor 
protrusions no greater than 0.25in (0.64cm) such as bolt heads, fastener ends, weld beads, and rivets 
are not considered part of the ROBOT PERIMETER. 
To determine the ROBOT PERIMETER, wrap a piece of string around the outer 
most parts of the ROBOT (excluding BUMPERS) at the BUMPER ZONE described 
in R405 and pull it taut. The string outlines the ROBOT PERIMETER.  
Example: A ROBOT’S chassis is shaped like the letter ‘U’, with a large gap 
between chassis elements on the front of the ROBOT. When wrapping a taut 
string around this chassis, the string extends across the gap and the resulting 
ROBOT PERIMETER is a rectangle with 4 sides. 
Figure 8-1 ROBOT PERIMETER example 
 
R102 *STARTING CONFIGURATION – no overhang. In the STARTING CONFIGURATION (the physical 
configuration in which a ROBOT starts a MATCH), no part of the ROBOT shall extend outside the 
vertical projection of the ROBOT PERIMETER, with the exception of its BUMPERS and minor protrusions 
such as bolt heads, fastener ends, rivets, cable ties, etc. 
If a ROBOT is designed as intended and each side is pushed up against a vertical 
wall (in STARTING CONFIGURATION and with BUMPERS removed), only the 
ROBOT PERIMETER (or minor protrusions) will be in contact with the wall. 
The allowance for minor protrusions in this rule is intended to allow protrusions 
that are both minor in extension from the ROBOT PERIMETER and cross-
sectional area. 
If a ROBOT uses interchangeable MECHANISMS per I103, Teams should be 
prepared to show compliance with this rule and R105 in all configurations. 
R103 *ROBOT weight limit. The ROBOT weight must not exceed 115.0lb (52.16kg). When determining 
weight, the basic ROBOT structure and all elements of all additional MECHANISMS that might be used 
in a single configuration of the ROBOT shall be weighed together (see I103).  
For the purposes of determining compliance with the weight limitations, the following items are 
excluded:  


---

Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 75 of 162 
A. ROBOT BUMPERS,  
B. ROBOT battery and its associated half of the Anderson cable quick connect/disconnect pair 
(including wire, the associated cable lugs, connecting bolts, and insulation), and  
C. tags used for location detection systems if provided by the event. 
R104 STARTING CONFIGURATION – max size. A ROBOT’S STARTING CONFIGURATION may not have a 
ROBOT PERIMETER greater than 110.0in (2.794m) and may not be more than 30in (76.2cm) tall.  
Be sure to consider the size of the ROBOT on its cart to make sure it will fit 
through doors. Also consider the size of the ROBOT to ensure that it will fit into a 
shipping crate, vehicle, etc. 
Note that rules contained in section 8.4 BUMPER Rules may impose additional 
restrictions on ROBOT design. 
R105 ROBOT horizontal extension limit. ROBOTS may not extend more than 12in (30.48cm) beyond the 
vertical projection of their ROBOT PERIMETER.  
Figure 8-2 ROBOT PERIMETER extension 
 
Teams should expect to have to demonstrate a ROBOT’S ability to constrain 
itself per above during inspection. Constraints may be implemented with either 
hardware or software. 
R106 Horizontal extension – one direction at a time. ROBOTS may not extend beyond their ROBOT 
PERIMETER in more than one direction (i.e. over more than 1 side of the ROBOT) at a time. The 
extension may not reach outside the projection of that side of the ROBOT PERIMETER.  
For the purposes of this rule, a round or circular section of FRAME PERIMETER is considered to have an 
infinite number of sides. MOMENTARY and inconsequential extensions in multiple directions are an 
exception to this rule. 
Examples of MOMENTARY and inconsequential actions include a wire or cable 
tie swinging out of the ROBOT PERIMETER, including while an extension is 
deployed out a different side.

Examples of compliance and non-compliance of this rule are shown in Figure 8-3.  
Yellow bars represent the limits of the ROBOT PERIMETER and are drawn in the 
same orientation of the ROBOT’S PERIMETER.  
Green bars represent a measured extension from the ROBOT PERIMETER that 
does not exceed the limit defined in R105.  
− ROBOT A violates this rule for extending in more than one direction 
− ROBOT B violates this rule for extending in more than one direction 
− ROBOT C does not violate this rule 
− ROBOT D does not violate this rule as the additional extension is momentary 
and inconsequential 
− ROBOT E does not violate this rule 
− ROBOT F violates this rule for extending in more than one direction by 
extending over a round segment of ROBOT PERIMETER.

Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 77 of 162 
R107 ROBOT vertical extension limit. ROBOTS may not extend such that their total height exceeds 30.0in 
(76.2cm). 
This measurement is intended to be made as if the ROBOT is resting on a flat 
floor (without changing the ROBOT configuration), not relative to the current 
height of the ROBOT from the FIELD carpet at any given time (i.e. the 
measurement is made perpendicular to the ROBOT PERIMETER polygon). 
R108 ROBOT extension floor interaction ROBOT extensions may not interact with the carpet, BUMPS, or 
TOWER BASE such that the BUMPERS are lifted out of the BUMPER ZONE (see R405). 
8.2 ROBOT Safety & Damage Prevention 
R201 *No digging into carpet. Traction devices must not have surface features that could damage the 
ARENA (e.g. metal, sandpaper, inflexible studs, cleats, hook-loop fasteners or similar attachments). 
Traction devices include all parts of the ROBOT that are designed to transmit any propulsive and/or 
braking forces between the ROBOT and FIELD carpet. 
R202 *No exposed sharp edges. Protrusions from the ROBOT and exposed surfaces on the ROBOT shall not 
pose hazards to the ARENA elements (including SCORING ELEMENTS) or people. 
Note that the use of acrylic or other materials which may break into jagged 
pieces is not explicitly prohibited, but any such breakage must be corrected 
immediately to comply with this rule. 
R203 *General safety. ROBOT parts shall not be made from hazardous materials, be unsafe, cause an unsafe 
condition, or interfere with the operation of other ROBOTS. 
Examples of items that will violate this rule include (but are not limited to): 
A. shields, curtains, or any other devices or materials designed or used to 
obstruct or limit the vision of any DRIVE TEAM members and/or interfere with 
their ability to safely control their ROBOT, 
B. speakers, sirens, air horns, or other audio devices that generate sound at a 
level sufficient to be a distraction, 
C. any devices or decorations specifically intended to jam or interfere with the 
remote sensing capabilities of another ROBOT, including vision systems, 
acoustic range finders, sonars, infrared proximity detectors, etc. (e.g. 
including imagery on your ROBOT that utilizes or closely mimics 36h11 
AprilTags), 
D. lasers other than those listed as IEC/EN 60825-1 ”Class 1” or IEC/EN 62471 
“Exempt,” 
E. flammable gasses, 
F. any device intended to produce flames or pyrotechnics, 
G. hydraulic fluids or hydraulic items,  
H. switches or contacts containing liquid mercury, 
I. circuitry used to create voltages in excess of 24 Volts, 
J. any ballast not secured sufficiently, including loose ballast e.g. sand, ball 
bearings, etc., such that it may become loose during a MATCH, 

---


## Page 78

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 78 of 162 
K. hazardous materials (e.g. lead, whether encapsulated or not) used on the 
ROBOT,  
L. high intensity light sources used on the ROBOT (e.g. super bright LED sources 
marketed as ‘military grade’ or ‘self-defense’) may only be illuminated for a 
brief time while targeting and may need to be shrouded to prevent any 
exposure to participants. Complaints about the use of such light sources will 
be followed by re-inspection and possible disablement of the device, and 
M. Bright lights which flash more than approximately 5 times per second, per 
E108. 
R204 *Leave SCORING ELEMENTS at the FIELD. ROBOTS must allow removal of SCORING ELEMENTS from 
the ROBOT and the ROBOT from FIELD elements while DISABLED and powered off. 
ROBOTS will not be re-enabled after the MATCH, so teams must be sure that 
SCORING ELEMENTS and ROBOTS can be quickly, simply, and safely removed.  
Teams are encouraged to consider G501 when developing their ROBOTS. 
R205 *Don’t contaminate the FIELD. Liquids, gels, greases and fine particles must not contaminate the FIELD 
or other ROBOTS. 
R206 *Don’t damage SCORING ELEMENTS. ROBOT elements likely to come in contact with a SCORING 
ELEMENT shall not pose a significant hazard to the SCORING ELEMENT. 
SCORING ELEMENTS are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear and 
tear as they are handled by ROBOTS, such as scratching or marking. Gouging, 
tearing off pieces, or routinely marking SCORING ELEMENTS are violations of 
this rule. 
8.3 Budget Constraints & Fabrication Schedule 
R301 *Individual item cost limit. No individual, non-KOP item or software shall have a Fair Market Value 
(FMV) that exceeds $600 USD. The total cost of COMPONENTS purchased in bulk may exceed $600 
USD as long as the cost of an individual COMPONENT does not exceed $600 USD.  
Teams should be ready to show INSPECTORS documentation of FMV for any 
COMPONENTS that appear to be in the range of the $600 USD limit. 
The Analog Devices IMU MXP Breakout Board, P/N ADIS16448, does not have a 
published FMV. This device is considered to comply with this rule regardless of 
its true FMV. 
The FMV of a COTS item is its price defined by a VENDOR for the part or an 
identical functional replacement. This price must be generally available to all 
FIRST Robotics Competition teams throughout the build and competition season 
(i.e. short-term sale prices or coupons do not reflect FMV), however teams are 
only expected to make a good faith effort at determining the item price and are 
not expected to monitor prices of ROBOT items throughout the season. The FMV 
is the cost of the item itself and does not include any duties, taxes, tariffs, 
shipping, or other costs that may vary by locality. 

---


## Page 79

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 79 of 162 
The FMV of COTS software is the price, set by the VENDOR, to license the 
software (or piece of the software) that runs on the ROBOT for the period from 
Kickoff to the end of the FIRST Championship. The FMV of software licensed 
free-of-cost, including through the Virtual KOP, for use on the ROBOT is $0. 
The FMV of FABRICATED parts is the value of the material and/or labor, except 
for labor provided by team members (including sponsor employees who are 
members of the team), members of other teams, and/or event provided machine 
shops. Material costs are accounted for as the cost of any purchasable quantity 
that can be used to make the individual part (i.e. the purchasable raw material is 
larger than the FABRICATED part). 
Example 1: A team orders a custom bracket made by a company to the team's 
specification. The company’s material cost and normally charged labor rate 
apply. 
Example 2: A team receives a donated sensor. The company would normally sell 
this item for $450 USD, which is therefore its FMV. 
Example 3: A team purchases titanium tube stock for $400 USD and has it 
machined by a local machine shop. The machine shop is not considered a team 
sponsor but donates 2 hours of expended labor anyway. The team must include 
the estimated normal cost of the labor as if it were paid to the machine shop and 
add it to the $400 USD. 
Example 4: A team purchases titanium tube stock for $400 USD and has it 
machined by a local machine shop that is a recognized sponsor of the team. If 
the machinists are considered members of the team, their labor costs do not 
apply. The total applicable cost for the part would be $400 USD. 
It is in the best interests of the teams and FIRST to form relationships with as 
many organizations as possible. Recognizing supporting companies as sponsors 
of, and members in, the team is encouraged, even if the involvement of the 
sponsor is solely through the donation of fabrication labor. 
Example 5: A team purchases titanium tube stock for $400 USD and has it 
machined by another team. The total applicable cost for the part would be $400 
USD. 
Example 6: A team purchases a widget at a garage sale or online auction for 
$300, but it’s available for sale from a VENDOR for $700. The FMV is $700. 
If a COTS item is part of a modular system that can be assembled in several 
possible configurations, then each individual module must fit within the price 
constraints defined in this rule.  
If the modules are designed to assemble into a single configuration, and the 
assembly is functional in only that configuration, then the total cost of the 
complete assembly including all modules must fit within the price constraints 
defined in this rule.

Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 80 of 162 
In summary, if a VENDOR sells a system or a kit, a team must use the entire 
system/kit FMV and not the value of its COMPONENT pieces. 
Example 7: VENDOR A sells a gearbox that can be used with a number of 
different gear sets, and can mate with 2 different motors they sell. A team 
purchases the gearbox, a gear set, and a motor, then assembles them together. 
Each part is treated separately for the purpose of determining FMV since the 
purchased pieces can each be used in various configurations. 
Example 8: VENDOR B sells a robotic arm assembly that a team wants to use. 
However, it costs $630 USD, so they cannot use it. The VENDOR sells the “hand”, 
“wrist”, and “arm” as separate assemblies, for $210 USD each. A team wishes to 
purchase the 3 items separately, then reassemble them. This would not be legal, 
as they are really buying and using the entire assembly, which has a Fair Market 
Value of $630 USD. 
Example 9: VENDOR C sells a set of wheels or wheel modules that are often used 
in groups of 4. The wheels or modules can be used in other quantities or 
configurations. A team purchases 4 and uses them in the most common 
configuration. Each part is treated separately for the purpose of determining 
FMV, since the purchased pieces can be used in various configurations. 
R302 *MAJOR MECHANISM, from this year only. MAJOR MECHANISMS, as defined in I101, created before 
Kickoff are not permitted. 
Neither this rule nor the language in this blue box define specific thresholds for 
how much of a MAJOR MECHANISM must be constructed after Kickoff. This rule 
expects and requires the team’s honest assessment of whether they built the 
MAJOR MECHANISMS of their ROBOT after Kickoff. 
Attempts to exploit loopholes in the definition of MAJOR MECHANISM in order to 
bypass this requirement are in the spirit of neither this rule nor FIRST Robotics 
Competition. Examples of exploitation include: 
A. Pre-assembling significant portions of a MAJOR MECHANISM prior to Kickoff 
and attaching those assemblies together post-Kickoff, 
B. Removing a small COMPONENT of a MAJOR MECHANISM prior to Kickoff 
such that it is no longer a MAJOR MECHANISM and replacing it after Kickoff. 
R303 *Create new designs and software, unless they’re public. ROBOT software and designs created before 
Kickoff are only permitted if the source files (complete information sufficient to produce the design) 
are available publicly prior to Kickoff. 
Example 1: A team realizes that the transmission designed and built in the fall 
perfectly fits their need for a transmission to drive the ROBOT arm. They build an 
exact copy of the transmission from the original design plans and bolt it to the 
ROBOT. This would be prohibited, as the transmission – although made during 
the competition season – was built from detailed designs developed prior to 
Kickoff.

Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 81 of 162 
Example 2: A team developed an omni-directional drive system for the 2019 
competition. In July 2019 they refined and improved the control software, written 
in C++, to add more precision and capabilities. They decided to use a similar 
system for the REBUILT competition. They copied large sections of unmodified 
code over into the control software of the new ROBOT, also written in C++. This 
would be a violation of the schedule constraint and is not allowed. 
Example 3: The same team decides to use LabVIEW as their software 
environment for REBUILT. Following Kickoff, they use the previously developed 
C++ code as a reference for the algorithms and calculations required to 
implement their omni-directional control solution. Because they developed new 
LabVIEW code as they ported over their algorithms, this is permitted. 
Example 4: A different team develops a similar solution during the fall and plans 
to use the developed software on their competition ROBOT. After completing the 
software, they post it in a generally accessible public forum and make the code 
available to all teams. Because they have made their software publicly available 
before Kickoff, they can use it on their ROBOT. 
Example 5: A team develops a transmission prior to Kickoff. After completing the 
project, they publish the CAD files on a generally accessible public forum and 
make them available to all teams. Because they have made the design publicly 
available before Kickoff, they can use the design to create an identical 
transmission, fabricated after Kickoff, for use on their REBUILT ROBOT. 
8.4 BUMPER Rules  
A BUMPER is a required assembly which attaches to the ROBOT frame. BUMPERS protect ROBOTS from 
damaging/being damaged by other ROBOTS and FIELD elements.  
A BUMPER guide providing additional information on materials and design based on historical best practices 
may be found under the Mechanical Resources section of the Technical Resources page. Teams may also 
reference the KitBot Instructions for a detailed step-by-step on how to build bumpers for the KitBot.  
All dimensions specified in this section are nominal and will be measured during inspection with a tolerance of 
0.25in (0.63cm) unless otherwise specified. This means that maximums specified have a tolerance of +0.25in 
(0.63cm) and minimums specified have a tolerance of –0.25in (0.63cm). Teams are encouraged to design to 
the nominal dimension and reserve the tolerance for unexpected deviation such as manufacturing error or 
tolerance stack-up. 
R401 *BUMPERS almost all around. ROBOTS are required to use BUMPERS to protect the entire ROBOT 
PERIMETER. Gaps of less than 1.25in (3.17cm) between adjacent segments are permitted as long as 
all corners are filled per R406. A single gap larger than 1.25in (3.17cm) is permitted, as long as at least 
5.0in (12.7cm) of ROBOT PERIMETER on each side of each corner is protected by BUMPER.  
An arc is considered to have infinite corners and therefore may not have a gap 
larger than 1.25in (3.17cm).

Figure 8-4 BUMPER coverage requirements 
 
R402 *BUMPER construction. BUMPERS must consist of the following: 
A. Padding – A minimum of 2.25in (5.72cm) depth of foam padding, at least 4.5in (11.43cm) tall 
consisting of solid blocks, sheets, or stacked rods of one or more of the following materials: 
i. Solid pool noodles or backer rod  
ii. Solid polyethylene closed cell foam (including crosslinked) with density between 1.5 and 
3.0lb/ft3 (24.03 to 48.05kg/m3) 
iii. Solid EVA closed cell foam with density between 2.0 and 6.0lb/ft3 (32.04 to 96.11kg/m3) 
iv. Foam floor tiles  
Multiple types, shapes, and/or layers of foam may be used within a single BUMPER. 
Teams should be prepared to provide information about the padding 
material used in their BUMPERS. Teams do not need to have a separate 
material sample or expose padding for direct inspection to show 
compliance with this rule. 
B. Backing – A backer at least 4.5in (11.43cm) tall which supports the padding (i.e. padding is not 
cantilevered other than in corners) and facilitates installation and removal of the BUMPER from 
the ROBOT (as noted in R410). Additional elements may be added to strengthen the backing, fill 
space between the BUMPER and ROBOT frame, serve as part of the attachment system, or for 
any other purpose.

C. Cover – Cloth (as noted in R411) which covers all outward, upward and downward facing 
surfaces of padding such that no padding is exposed to interaction with the FIELD or other 
ROBOTs. 
D. Fastening System – BUMPERS must attach to the ROBOT PERIMETER with a rigid fastening 
system to form a tight, robust connection to the main structure/frame (e.g. not attached with 
hook-and-loop tape, tape, or cable ties). The fastening system must be designed to withstand 
vigorous game play. All removable fasteners (e.g. bolts, locking pins, quick release pins, etc.) 
may be considered part of either the BUMPERS or ROBOT for determination of weight per R103 
and R408. 
The BUMPER Rules provide teams significant freedom in choosing 
designs and materials. For information on a reference design, see the 
Bumper Guide under the Mechanical Resources section of the Technical 
Resouces Page.

R403 *BUMPER extension limit. BUMPERS must not extend more than 4.0in (10.16cm) from the ROBOT 
PERIMETER. 
Figure 8-7 BUMPER Extension Limit 
 
R404 *BUMPERS must be soft. Hard parts of BUMPERS must not extend more than 1.25in (3.17cm) out from 
the ROBOT PERIMETER. Only padding (per R402-A), cover (per R402-C, including any coatings or 
markings), and soft fasteners used to secure padding or cover are permitted beyond this limit. Padding 
must extend at least 2.0in (5.08cm) beyond any hard parts of the BUMPER. There is no limit on how far 
BUMPER hard parts may extend inside the ROBOT FRAME PERIMETER. 
Figure 8-8 BUMPER Hard Parts Limit

Hard parts include any items which are likely to cause damage to the cloth or 
padding of other BUMPERS such as nuts and bolts, cable ties, hard plastics, etc.  
R405 *BUMPERS interact with BUMPERS. While navigating the FIELD normally, all BUMPERS must have 
padding (per R402-A) supported by backing (per R402-B) entirely filling the BUMPER ZONE, a space 
between 2.5in (6.35cm) and 5.75in (14.61cm) from the floor.  
Figure 8-9 BUMPER ZONE examples 
 
This measurement is intended to be made in a ROBOT’S expected 
configuration(s) while navigating the FIELD and is relative to whatever surface 
the ROBOT is currently driving on. BUMPERS leaving the BUMPER ZONE due to 
ROBOTS inadvertently tipping is not a violation of this rule. 
 
R406 *Fill BUMPER corners. Corner joints between BUMPERS must be filled with uncompressed padding 
material extending at least 2.25in (5.72cm) from the corner with no gaps or voids. Examples of 
implementation are shown in Figure 8-10.

Figure 8-10 Uncompressed corner padding 
   
Separate bumper segments meeting at a miter in the corner are not considered 
to “fill” the corner due to the cloth covering and do not meet the requirements of 
this rule. 
R407 *BUMPERS shouldn’t be wedges. BUMPERS must not act as wedges when interacting with other 
BUMPERS. 
Examples of BUMPERS which might act as a wedge, and may invite additional 
scrutiny, include: 
A. BUMPERS utilizing softer foam towards the top of a BUMPER profile, 
B. BUMPERS utilizing excessively rounded profiles such as a single semi-circle, 
and 
C. BUMPERS with tapered or stepped padding such that the padding is thinner 
or thicker towards the top or bottom. 
R408 *Weight limit with BUMPERS. The total weight of the ROBOT (as described in R103) with BUMPERS 
must not exceed 135.0lb (61.23kg) 
R409 *BUMPERS should be passive. BUMPERS must be fixed relative to the ROBOT PERIMETER. BUMPERS 
may not contain any moving elements (beyond compression and flex of BUMPER materials) or 
electrical elements.

Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 87 of 162 
R410 *BUMPERS must come off. BUMPERS must be designed for installation and removal to facilitate 
inspection and weighing.  
As a guideline, BUMPERS should be able to be installed or removed by 2 people 
in fewer than 5 minutes.  
R411 *BUMPERS indicate your ALLIANCE. Each ROBOT must be able to display red or blue BUMPER covers 
to reflect their ALLIANCE color, as assigned in the MATCH schedule distributed at the event (as 
described in section 10.1 MATCH Schedules). Contrasting markings on outward, upward, or downward 
facing surfaces of the BUMPER cover, other than the following, are prohibited: 
A. those required per R412,  
B. hook-and-loop tape, snap fasteners, or functional equivalents backed by the hard parts of the 
BUMPER, 
C. solid white FIRST logos between 4.75in (12.06cm) and 5.25in (13.33cm) wide (i.e. comparable 
to those available in the REBUILT Virtual Kit), and  
D. narrow areas of underlying cloth exposed at seams, corners, or folds. 
R412 *Team number on BUMPERS. Team numbers must be displayed and positioned on the BUMPER cover 
in at least 3 locations approximately 90 degrees apart such that an observer walking around the 
perimeter of the ROBOT can unambiguously tell the team’s number from most points of view, from as 
far as approximately 720.0in (18.29m). Team numbers must meet the following additional criteria: 
A. consist of only white Arabic numerals at least 3.75in (9.53cm) high, at least 0.5in (1.27cm) in 
stroke width, 
The 0.5in (1.27cm) stroke width requirement applies to the majority of the stroke. 
Font elements less than 0.5in (1.27cm) such as serifs, rounded edges, small 
hairlines or gaps, etc. are permitted as long as the majority of the stroke meets 
the sizing requirement and the numbers are unambiguous. 
B. must not wrap around sharp corners (less than 135.0°) of the ROBOT PERIMETER,  
C. must not split individual digits such that the team number is ambiguous, and 
As a guideline, spacing between digits or groups of digits which exceeds ~4.0in 
(10.16cm) may be ambiguous. 
D. may not substitute logos or icons for numerals. 
There is no prohibition against splitting team numbers onto different sections of 
BUMPER. The intent is that the team’s number is clearly visible and unambiguous 
so that Judges, REFEREES, Announcers, and other teams can easily identify 
competing ROBOTS. 
This marking is intended to display the team number only, not to intentionally 
change the surface characteristics of the BUMPER. Excessive material usage as 
part of any team number marking will invite close scrutiny.

COTS brushed motors, linear actuators, electrical solenoid actuators, or electromagnets rated for 
12V and wired to an approved power regulating device downstream of a breaker 20A or less. 
Electrical solenoid actuators or electromagnets used at 24V must be rated for 24V. 
For servos, note that the roboRIO is limited to a max current output of 2.2A on the 
6V rail (12.4W of electrical input power). Teams should make sure that their total 
servo power usage remains below this limit at all times. 
Servo mechanical output power is approximated by the following formula (using 
6V data reported by manufacturer): Mechanical Output Power (in W) = 0.25 x 
(Stall Torque in N-m) x (No Load Speed in rad/s). This calculator from the FIRST 
Tech Challenge documentation can be used to help calculate output power from 
inputs of various units. 
Given the extensive amount of motors allowed on the ROBOT, teams are 
encouraged to consider the total power available from the ROBOT battery during 
the design and build of the ROBOT. Drawing large amounts of current from many 
motors at the same time could lead to drops in ROBOT battery voltage that may 
result in tripping the main breaker or trigger the brownout protection of the 
roboRIO. For more information about the roboRIO brownout protection and 
measuring current draw using the PDP/PDH, see roboRIO Brownout and 
Understanding Current Draw. 
AndyMark PG Gearmotors are sold with labeling based on the entire assembly. 
Assemblies labeled am-3651 through am-3656 contain legal motors specified in

Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R) V0 - Kickoff 90 of 162 
R502 *Only 4 propulsion motors. A ROBOT may not have more than 4 propulsion motors. A propulsion motor 
is a motor that enables the ROBOT to move around the FIELD surface. Motors that generate small 
amounts of thrust as a secondary or incidental feature are not considered propulsion motors. 
Examples that are not considered propulsion motors include: 
A. motors that primarily alter the alignment of a wheel in contact with the FIELD 
surface (such as a swerve steering motor), 
B. motors that run MECHANISM wheels (e.g. for SCORING ELEMENT 
manipulation) that occasionally happen to contact the carpet, but without 
enough force to generate significant thrust, and 
C. motors that change the speed of the drive wheels using a shifting 
MECHANISM without significantly contributing to propulsion. 
R503 *Don’t modify motors (mostly). The integral mechanical and electrical system of any motor must not 
be modified. Motors, servos, and electric solenoids used on the ROBOT shall not be modified in any 
way, except as follows: 
A. The mounting brackets and/or output shaft/interface may be modified to facilitate the physical 
connection of the motor to the ROBOT and actuated part.  
B. The electrical leads may be trimmed to length as necessary and connectors or splices to 
additional wiring may be added. 
C. The locking pins on the window motors (P/N 262100-3030 and 262100-3040) may be removed.  
D. The connector housings on KOP automotive motors listed in Table 8-1 may be modified to 
facilitate lead connections. 
E. Servos may be modified as specified by the manufacturer (e.g. re-programming or modification 
for continuous rotation). 
F. Minimal labeling may be applied to indicate device purpose, connectivity, functional 
performance, etc. 
G. Any number of #10-32 plug screws may be removed from the Falcon 500 and the Kraken X60. 
H. Insulation may be applied to electrical terminals. 
I. Repairs, provided the original performance and specifications are unchanged. 
J. Maintenance recommended by the manufacturer.  
The intent of this rule is to allow teams to modify mounting tabs and the like, not 
to gain a weight reduction by potentially compromising the structural integrity of 
any motor.  
R504 *Power (most) actuators off of approved devices. With the exception of servos, fans, or motors 
integral to sensors of COTS computing devices permitted in R501, each actuator must be controlled by 
a power regulating device. The only power regulating devices for actuators permitted on the ROBOT 
include:  
A. motor controllers: 
a. Koors40 Motor Controller (P/N am-5600), 
b. Spark Flex Motor Controller (P/N REV-11-2159, am-5276) 
c. Spark Motor Controller (P/N REV-11-1200, am-4260), 
d. Spark MAX Motor Controller (P/N REV-11-2158, am-4261),
