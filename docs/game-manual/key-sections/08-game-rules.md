Section 6 Game Details V0 - Kickoff 52 of 162 
Some events may restrict ARENA access to members of the DRIVE TEAM. Team 
members are permitted to swap buttons within their team as needed to access 
the Question Box. 
As much as possible, the STUDENT should be an active participant in the 
conversation. 
Teams should not record interactions without consent (see E117). 
Q102 Conversations must be civil. Any team interaction with the Head REFEREE must be appropriate. 
Violation: The Head REFEREE may terminate the conversation to allow time for parties to cool down. A 
person with subsequent violations will not be allowed to interact with the Head REFEREE. 
Examples of inappropriate behavior are outlined in G201.  
6.8 Other Logistics 
SCORING ELEMENTS that leave the FIELD (other than through the OUTPOST) are placed back into the FIELD 
approximately at the point of exit by FIELD STAFF (REFEREES, FTAs, or other staff working around the FIELD) 
at the earliest safe opportunity.  
Note that ROBOTS and HUMAN PLAYERS may not deliberately cause SCORING 
ELEMENTS to leave the FIELD (see G405). 
An ARENA FAULT (an error in ARENA operation described in section 10.2 MATCH Replays) is not called for 
MATCHES that accidentally begin with damaged SCORING ELEMENTS. Damaged SCORING ELEMENTS are not 
replaced until the next ARENA reset period. DRIVE TEAMS should alert the FIELD STAFF to any missing or 
damaged SCORING ELEMENTS prior to the start of the MATCH but as noted in 6.3.4, the exact number of FUEL 
in the NEUTRAL ZONE may vary.  
Once the MATCH is over and the Head REFEREE determines that the FIELD is safe for FIELD STAFF and DRIVE 
TEAMS, they or their designee change the FIELD lights to green and DRIVE TEAMS may retrieve their ROBOT. 
Some MATCHES may include a short period afterward to allow FIELD staff to begin to clean the field to make it 
easier and safer for teams to collect their robot. This period is indicated with purple lights on the team signs 
and the word “clean” displayed. TEAMS are not allowed on the field during this time. 
During ARENA reset, the ARENA is cleared of ROBOTS and OPERATOR CONSOLES from the MATCH that just 
ended, ROBOTS and OPERATOR CONSOLES for the subsequent MATCH are loaded into the ARENA by DRIVE 
TEAMS, and FIELD STAFF reset ARENA elements. 
FIRST Robotics Competition uses 3 words in the context of how durations and actions are assessed with 
regards to evaluation of rules and assignment of violations. These words provide general guidance to describe 
benchmarks to be used across the program. It is not the intent for REFEREES to provide a count during the 
time periods. 
− MOMENTARY describes durations that are fewer than approximately 3 seconds. 
− CONTINUOUS describes durations that are more than approximately 10 seconds. 
− REPEATED describes actions that happen more than once within a MATCH.

7 Game Rules  (G)  
7.1 Personal Safety 
G101 *Humans, remain outside the FIELD. A team member may not reach into the FIELD with any part of 
their body during a MATCH . 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event. 
Violations of this rule apply to the entire team, not specifically to any 1 individual. 
For example, a member of Team 9999 reaches onto the FIELD during MATCH 3, 
and a different member reaches onto the FIELD during MATCH 25. The team 
receives a VERBAL WARNING for the first violation and a YELLOW CARD for the 
second. 
G102 *Never step over the guardrail. A team member may only enter or exit the FIELD through open gates 
and only enter if FIELD lighting (FIELD facing side of the team signs and timers) is green, unless 
explicitly instructed by a REFEREE or an FTA. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event. 
Teams are encouraged to ensure that all members of their DRIVE TEAM are 
aware of this rule. It’s easy to violate, particularly when teams are doing their best 
to move on and off the FIELD quickly. The violations of this rule are intended to 
avoid nuisance penalties, but still enforce safety requirements around the FIELD. 
There is the potential for injury when stepping over the guardrail. 
Violations of this rule apply to the entire team, not specifically to any 1 individual. 
For example, a member of Team 9999 steps over the guardrail prior to MATCH 3, 
and a different member steps over the guardrail prior to MATCH 25. The team 
receives a VERBAL WARNING for the first violation and a YELLOW CARD for the 
second.  
G103 *Be careful what you interact with. A team member is prohibited from the following actions with 
regards to interaction with ARENA elements.  
A. climbing on or inside, 
A. hanging from, 
B. manipulating such that it doesn’t return to its original shape without human intervention, and 
C. damaging. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event. 
The REBUILT FIELD has obstacles, and caution should be applied when 
navigating the FIELD. Teams should avoid carrying their ROBOT over the BUMP. 
Walking over the BUMP is not considered climbing on. 

---


## Page 54

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 54 of 162 
G104 *Teams may not enable their ROBOTS on the FIELD. Teams may not tether to the ROBOT while on the 
FIELD except in special circumstances (e.g. after Opening Ceremonies, before an immediate MATCH 
replay, etc.) and with the express permission from the FTA or a REFEREE.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event. 
Teams are encouraged to consider this rule when developing their ROBOTS. 
FMS will not enable ROBOTS after the conclusion of the MATCH. 
For the purposes of this rule, tethering includes any wired or wireless connection 
used to electrically energize and/or control elements on the ROBOT. The safety 
of teams and volunteers in close proximity to ROBOTS and ARENA elements on 
the FIELD is of the utmost importance, therefore ROBOTS or ROBOT 
COMPONENTS may not be enabled in any way on the FIELD before or after the 
MATCH. 
ROBOTS need to be safely transported off the FIELD and back to the pits after the 
MATCH, and there may be bystanders, doorways, or height restrictions along the 
route. 
7.2 Conduct 
G201 *Be a good person. All teams must be civil toward everyone and respectful of team and event 
equipment while at a FIRST Robotics Competition event. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event. 
Examples of inappropriate behavior include, but are not limited to, the use of 
offensive language or other uncivil conduct.  
Examples of particularly contemptible behavior that is likely to result in ARENA 
ejection include, but are not limited to, the following: 
A. assault, e.g. throwing something that hits another person (even if 
unintended), 
B. threat, e.g. saying something like “if you don’t reverse that call, I’ll make you 
regret it,” 
C. harassment, e.g. badgering someone with no new information after a 
decision’s been made or a question’s been answered, 
D. bullying, e.g. using body or verbal language to cause another person to feel 
inadequate, 
E. insulting, e.g. telling someone they don’t deserve to be on a DRIVE TEAM, 
F. swearing at another person (versus swearing under one’s breath or at 
oneself), and 
G. yelling at another person(s) in anger or frustration. 
G202 *Don’t bang on the glass. A team member may never strike or hit the DRIVER STATION plastic 
windows. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event.

Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 55 of 162 
G203 *Asking other teams to throw a MATCH – not cool. A team may not encourage an ALLIANCE of which 
it is not a member to play beneath its ability.  
Note: This rule is not intended to prevent an ALLIANCE from planning and/or executing its own strategy 
in a specific MATCH in which all the teams are members of the ALLIANCE. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. RED CARD if subsequent violations during the event. 
Example 1: A MATCH is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team C is 
encouraged by Team D to not get on the TOWER at the end of the MATCH, 
resulting in Teams A, B, and C not earning a Ranking Point. Team D’s motivation 
for this behavior is to prevent Team A from rising in the Tournament rankings 
and negatively affecting Team D’s ranking. Team D has violated this rule. 
Example 2: A MATCH is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team A is 
assigned to participate as a SURROGATE. Team D encourages Team A to not 
participate in the MATCH so that Team D gains ranking position over Teams B 
and C. Team D has violated this rule. 
Example 3: Asking a team to “no show” for a MATCH.  
FIRST considers the action of a team influencing another team to throw a 
MATCH, to deliberately miss Ranking Points, etc. incompatible with FIRST values 
and not a strategy any team should employ. 
G204 *Letting someone coerce you into throwing a MATCH – also not cool. A team, as the result of 
encouragement by a team not on their ALLIANCE, may not play beneath its ability.  
Note: This rule is not intended to prevent an ALLIANCE from planning and/or executing its own strategy 
in a specific MATCH in which all the ALLIANCE members are participants. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. RED CARD if subsequent violations during the event. 
Example 1: A MATCH is being played by Teams A, B, and C. Team D requests 
Team C ignore the TOWER at the end of the MATCH, resulting in Teams A, B, and 
C not being able to earn the TRAVERSAL RP. Team C accepts this request from 
Team D. Team D’s motivation for this behavior is to prevent Team A from rising 
in the Tournament rankings negatively affecting Team D’s ranking. Team C has 
violated this rule. 
Example 2: A MATCH is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team A is 
assigned to participate as a SURROGATE. Team A accepts Team D’s request not 
to participate in the MATCH so that Team D gains ranking position over Teams B 
and C. Team A has violated this rule. 
FIRST considers the action of a team influencing another team to throw a 
MATCH, to deliberately miss Ranking Points, etc. incompatible with FIRST values 
and not a strategy any team should employ.

Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 56 of 162 
G205 *Throwing your own MATCH is bad. A team may not intentionally lose a MATCH or sacrifice Ranking 
Points in an effort to lower their own ranking or manipulate the rankings of other teams. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. RED CARD if subsequent violations during the event. 
The intent of this rule is not to punish teams who are employing alternate 
strategies,  but rather to ensure that it is clear that throwing MATCHES to 
negatively affect your own rankings, or to manipulate the rankings of other teams 
(i.e. throw a MATCH to lower a partner's ranking, and/or increase the ranking of 
another team not in the MATCH) is incompatible with FIRST values and not a 
strategy any team should employ. 
G206 *Don't violate rules for RPs. A team or ALLIANCE may not collude with another team to each 
purposefully violate a rule in an attempt to influence Ranking Points. 
Violation: YELLOW CARD and the ALLIANCE is ineligible for the BONUS RPs. 
For example, if Team A on the blue ALLIANCE agrees with Team F on the red 
ALLIANCE to contact each other while each ROBOT is climbing the TOWER 
resulting in both ALLIANCES being awarded the TRAVERSAL RP. 
G207 *Don’t abuse ARENA access. A team member (except DRIVERS, HUMAN PLAYERS, and DRIVE 
COACHES) granted access to restricted areas in and around the ARENA (e.g. via TECHNICIAN button, 
event issued Media badges, etc.) may not assist or use signaling devices during the MATCH. 
Exceptions will be granted for inconsequential infractions and in cases concerning safety. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event. 
The TECHNICIAN’S role is to help the team prepare the ROBOT so it can perform 
at its full potential during a MATCH. The TECHNICIAN, except as described at the 
end of section 6.2 DRIVE TEAM, is not an additional DRIVE COACH, DRIVER, or 
HUMAN PLAYER. 
Team members in open-access spectator seating areas are not considered to be 
in a restricted area and are not prevented from assisting or using signaling 
devices. See E102 for related details.  
G208 *Show up to your Qualification MATCHES. If a ROBOT has passed initial, complete inspection, at least 
1 member of its DRIVE TEAM must report to the ARENA and participate in each of their assigned 
Qualification MATCHES. 
Violation: DISQUALIFIED from the current MATCH.

Figure 7-1 MATCH participation flowchart 
 
The team should inform the Lead Queuer if the team’s ROBOT is not able to 
participate. 
G209 *Keep your ROBOT together. A ROBOT may not intentionally detach or leave a part on the FIELD. 
Violation: RED CARD. 
G210 *Don’t expect to gain by doing others harm. A strategy not consistent with standard gameplay and 
clearly aimed at forcing the opponent ALLIANCE to violate a rule is not in the spirit of FIRST Robotics 
Competition and not allowed. Rule violations forced in this manner will not result in an assignment of a 
penalty to the targeted ALLIANCE. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. YELLOW CARD if REPEATED. 
This rule does not apply for strategies consistent with standard gameplay, for 
example: 
A. a red ALLIANCE ROBOT attempting to climb their TOWER in the final 30 
seconds of the MATCH contacts a blue ALLIANCE ROBOT. 
B. a blue ALLIANCE ROBOT is attempting to play defense on a red ALLIANCE 
ROBOT attempting to score into the HUB from within their ALLIANCE ZONE 
and pushes them outside their ALLIANCE ZONE. 
This rule requires an intentional act with limited or no opportunity for the team 
being acted on to avoid the penalty such as: 


---


## Page 58

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 58 of 162 
C. forcing an opponent ROBOT to catch FUEL by pushing them far from (i.e. 
more than 48.0in (1.22m)) the HUB exit to under the HUB exit to make them 
violate G408. 
D. a blue ALLIANCE ROBOT, pushing a red ALLIANCE ROBOT far from (i.e. more 
than 48.0in (1.22m)) the TOWER into another red ALLIANCE ROBOT which is 
in contact with the TOWER and the REFEREE perceiving that the blue ROBOT 
is deliberately making the red ROBOT violate G420. 
G211 *Egregious or exceptional violations. Egregious behavior beyond what is listed in the rules or 
subsequent violations of any rule or procedure during the event is prohibited. 
In addition to rule violations explicitly listed in this manual and witnessed by a REFEREE, the Head 
REFEREE may assign a YELLOW or RED CARD for egregious ROBOT actions or team member behavior 
at any time during the event.  
Please see section 6.6.1 YELLOW and RED CARDS for additional detail.  
Violation: YELLOW or RED CARD. 
The intent of this rule is to provide the Head REFEREES the flexibility necessary 
to keep the event running smoothly, as well as keep the safety of all the 
participants as the highest priority. Behaviors that put the FIRST community or 
integrity of the game at risk are not allowed and are violations of this rule. Those 
behaviors include, but are not limited to the list below: 
A. inappropriate behavior as outlined in the blue box of G201, 
B. jumping over the guardrail,  
C. pushing past the FIELD reset person blocking an open gate to get on the 
FIELD, 
D. reaching into the FIELD and grabbing a ROBOT during a MATCH, 
E. a single PIN in excess of 15 seconds,  
F. exploiting the 3-second window after a MATCH described in section 6.5 
Scoring to avoid rule violations (e.g. triggering an over-extension that enables 
TOWER points or using a ROBOT’S residual energy to impact an opponent 
ROBOT on their TOWER),  
G. triggering scoring sensors or otherwise interfering with FMS or FIELD 
operation,  
H. intentionally crossing the CENTER LINE in AUTO in order to interfere with an 
opponent ROBOT’S AUTO, 
I. intentionally ejecting a large quantity of FUEL out of the FIELD,  
J. intentionally exceeding the expansion limits for strategic benefit (i.e. climb 
the TOWER, block part of the FIELD, etc.), 
K. a HUMAN PLAYER hoarding a large quantity of FUEL outside the designated 
locations in G427, 
L. Intentionally scoring a large quantity of FUEL into the HUB from the NEUTRAL 
ZONE.  
The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW or RED CARD for a single instance of 
a rule violation such as the examples given in items above, or for multiple 

---


## Page 59

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 59 of 162 
instances of any single rule violation. Teams should be aware that any rule in this 
manual could escalate to a YELLOW or RED CARD. The Head REFEREE has final 
authority on all rules and violations at an event. 
G212 *All teams can play. A team may not encourage another team to exclude their ROBOT or be BYPASSED 
from a qualification MATCH for any reason.  
Violation: YELLOW CARD. RED CARD if the ROBOT does not participate in the MATCH. 
7.3 Pre-MATCH 
G301 *Be prompt. A DRIVE TEAM member may not cause significant delays to the start of their MATCH. 
Causing a significant delay requires both of the following to be true: 
A. The expected MATCH start time has passed, and 
Event volunteers communicate schedule delays with teams to the best of their 
ability. The Pit Display (which is typically located near the Pit Administration 
desk) shows any event timing delay. Announcements on the FIELD and in the pits 
also provide information on delays, and any team uncertain of when to queue for 
a MATCH should communicate with queuing volunteers. 
During Qualification MATCHES, the expected start time of the MATCH is the time 
indicated on the MATCH schedule or the cycle time for current round minus 3 
minutes from the end of the previous MATCH (which is reflected on the schedule 
on the Pit Display), whichever is later. 
During Playoff MATCHES, the expected start time of the MATCH is the time 
indicated on the MATCH schedule or 15 minutes from either ALLIANCE’S 
previous MATCH, whichever is later. 
B. The DRIVE TEAM has access to the FIELD and is neither MATCH ready nor making a good faith 
effort, to quickly become MATCH ready. 
Teams that have violated G208 or have 1 DRIVE TEAM member present and have 
informed event staff that their ROBOT will not be participating in the MATCH are 
considered MATCH ready and not in violation of this rule. 
Violation: If a Qualification MATCH, VERBAL WARNING. MAJOR FOUL for the upcoming MATCH if a 
subsequent violation occurs within the tournament phase. If the DRIVE TEAM is not MATCH ready within 
2 minutes of the VERBAL WARNING/MAJOR FOUL and the Head REFEREE perceives no good faith effort 
by the DRIVE TEAM to quickly become MATCH ready, DISABLED.  
If a Playoff MATCH, VERBAL WARNING issued to the ALLIANCE. MAJOR FOUL for the ALLIANCE’S 
upcoming MATCH if a subsequent violation occurs within the tournament phase. If the ALLIANCE is not 
MATCH ready within 2 minutes of the VERBAL WARNING/MAJOR FOUL having been issued to all 3 teams 
and the Head REFEREE perceives no good faith effort by the DRIVE TEAM(s) to quickly become MATCH 
ready, the offending team’s ROBOT is DISABLED.

Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 60 of 162 
The intent of this rule is to provide an equitable amount of time for both 
ALLIANCES to prepare for each MATCH and give DRIVE TEAMS grace given 
extenuating circumstances that cause them to be late.  
Once a VERBAL WARNING /MAJOR FOUL is issued, the Head REFEREE starts a 
2-minute timer and makes a good faith effort to share the timer’s status with the 
delaying DRIVE TEAM.  
Being “MATCH ready” requires that the ROBOT is on the FIELD, in its STARTING 
CONFIGURATION, and turned on. Additionally, the DRIVE TEAM members must 
be in their starting positions. 
In general, good faith efforts to quickly become MATCH ready are entirely for the 
purposes of transitioning the ROBOT into a MATCH ready state (i.e. not attempts 
to significantly alter a ROBOT’s capabilities.) Examples of good faith efforts to 
quickly become MATCH ready include but are not limited to: 
A. walking safely towards the FIELD with a ROBOT that a team is not actively 
modifying, 
B. applying quick fixes such as tape or cable ties to make the ROBOT compliant 
with STARTING CONFIGURATION requirements, 
C. waiting for an OPERATOR CONSOLE computer to boot, and  
D. working with FIELD STAFF to get the ROBOT connected to the FIELD. 
Examples that are not considered good faith efforts to quickly become MATCH 
ready include but are not limited to: 
E. a ROBOT not moving to the FIELD,  
F. a ROBOT moving to the FIELD but being actively modified while doing so,  
G. a DRIVE TEAM member remaining on the FIELD once a MATCH is ready to 
begin (indicated by the green LEDs having turned off),  
H. installing BUMPERS, charging pneumatic systems, or any other ROBOT 
maintenance not considered a quick fix as described in item B above once on 
the FIELD,  
I. time-consuming use of alignment devices that are external to the ROBOT 
(e.g. a DRIVE TEAM could bring and use a measuring tape, as long as there is 
no delay to the MATCH by doing so), and 
J. repairs more substantial than those described in B.  
There are no rules that prohibit use of hand tools (including battery operated 
tools) while setting up ROBOTS from the FIELD, provided they do not cause 
significant delay or cause safety concerns. 
G302 *Limit what you use during a MATCH. Items used during a match must fit on your team’s DRIVER 
STATION shelf, be worn or held by members from your DRIVE TEAM, or be an item used as an 
accommodation (e.g. stools, crutches, etc.). Regardless of if the equipment fits the criteria above, it 
may not: 
A. be employed in a way that introduces a safety hazard,  
B. extend more than 78.0in (1.981m) above the floor, 

---


## Page 61

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 61 of 162 
C. communicate with anything or anyone outside of the ARENA with the exception of medically 
required equipment, 
D. block visibility for FIELD STAFF or audience members, or  
E. jam or interfere with the remote sensing capabilities of another team or the FIELD. 
Violation: MATCH will not start until the situation is remedied. If discovered or used inappropriately 
during a MATCH, YELLOW CARD. 
Examples of equipment that may be considered a safety hazard in the confined 
space of the ALLIANCE AREA include, but are not limited to, a folding step stool, 
ladder, or a large signaling device. 
Using an item that has wireless communications disabled complies with C 
above.  
Examples of jamming or interfering with remote sensing capabilities include, but 
are not limited to, mimicking the FIELD AprilTags and shining bright lighting or 
laser pointers onto the FIELD.  
G303 *Start your ROBOTS. A ROBOT must meet all following MATCH-start requirements:  
A. it does not pose a hazard to humans, FIELD elements, or other ROBOTS,  
B. has passed initial, complete inspection, i.e. it’s compliant with all ROBOT rules (for exceptions 
regarding Practice MATCHES, see section 9 Inspection & Eligibility (I), 
C. if modified after initial Inspection, it’s compliant with I104, 
D. its BUMPERS overlap their ROBOT STARTING LINE, 
E. it’s not contacting the BUMP, 
F. it’s the only team-provided item left on the FIELD, 
G. it’s not attached to, entangled with, or suspended from any FIELD element, 
H. it’s confined to its STARTING CONFIGURATION (reference R102 and R104), and 
I. it fully and solely supports not more than 8 FUEL (as described in section 6.3.4 SCORING 
ELEMENTS). 
Violation: If fix is a quick remedy, the MATCH won’t start until all requirements are met. If it is not a quick 
remedy, DISABLED and, at the discretion of the Head REFEREE, must be re-inspected. If a ROBOT not 
compliant with part B or C participates, its team receives a RED CARD. 
If a ROBOT is BYPASSED prior to the start of the MATCH, the DRIVE TEAM may 
not remove the ROBOT from the FIELD without permission from the Head 
REFEREE or the FTA. 
For assessment of many of the items listed above, the Head REFEREE is likely to 
consult with the LRI.

Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 62 of 162 
7.4 In-MATCH 
Rules in this section pertain to game play once a MATCH begins.  
7.4.1 AUTO 
The AUTO period is the first 20 seconds of the MATCH, and the FMS blocks any DRIVER control, so ROBOTS 
operate with only their pre-programmed instructions. Rules in this section apply only during the AUTO period.  
G401 *Behind the lines. In AUTO, each DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their staged areas. A DRIVE 
TEAM member staged behind a HUMAN STARTING LINE may not contact anything in front of that 
HUMAN STARTING LINE, unless for personal or equipment safety, to press the E-Stop or A-Stop, or 
granted permission by a Head REFEREE or FTA.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL regardless of the number of items contacted. 
Pointing, gesturing, or otherwise extending across the HUMAN STARTING LINE 
such that contact is not made with carpet or other ARENA elements is not a 
violation of this rule. 
An example of an exception for equipment safety is if an OPERATOR CONSOLE 
starts to fall from, or has already fallen off of, the DRIVER STATION shelf. In that 
circumstance, DRIVE TEAM members may step forward to catch it or pick it up 
off the ground and return it to the shelf. 
G402 *Let the ROBOT do its thing. In AUTO, a DRIVE TEAM member may not directly or indirectly interact 
with a ROBOT or an OPERATOR CONSOLE unless for personal safety, OPERATOR CONSOLE safety, or 
pressing an E-Stop or A-Stop. A HUMAN PLAYER entering FUEL onto the FIELD is an exception to this 
rule.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD.  
G403 Limited AUTO opponent interaction. In AUTO, a ROBOT whose BUMPERS are completely across the 
CENTER LINE (i.e. to the opposite side of the CENTER LINE from its ROBOT STARTING LINE) may not 
contact an opponent ROBOT. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. 
7.4.2 SCORING ELEMENTS 
G404 *ROBOTS: use SCORING ELEMENTS as directed. A ROBOT may not deliberately use a SCORING 
ELEMENT in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with a FIELD element.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL.  
Examples include, but are not limited to:  
A. launching SCORING ELEMENTS at opponent ROBOTS, 
B. using SCORING ELEMENTS to elevate ROBOTS in an attempt to climb the 
TOWER, 
C. positioning SCORING ELEMENTS to impede opponent access to their 
TOWER, 

---


## Page 63

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 63 of 162 
G405 *Keep SCORING ELEMENTS in bounds. A ROBOT may not intentionally eject SCORING ELEMENTS 
from the FIELD (either directly or by bouncing off a FIELD element or other ROBOT) with an exception of 
the OUTPOST.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL. If REPEATED, MAJOR FOUL. 
G406 *Don’t abuse SCORING ELEMENTS. Neither a ROBOT nor a HUMAN PLAYER may damage a SCORING 
ELEMENT.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. MAJOR FOUL if REPEATED in any subsequent MATCHES during the event. 
If via a ROBOT and the Head REFEREE determines that further damage is likely to occur, DISABLED. 
Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-
inspection) may be required before the ROBOT may compete in subsequent MATCHES. 
SCORING ELEMENTS are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear and 
tear as they are handled by ROBOTS, such as scratching or marking. Routinely 
gouging, tearing off pieces, or marking SCORING ELEMENTS are violations of this 
rule. 
G407 Only score while in your ALLIANCE ZONE. A ROBOT may not launch a SCORING ELEMENT into their 
HUB unless their BUMPERS are partially or fully within their ALLIANCE ZONE.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL 
G408 Don’t catch FUEL. A ROBOT may not do either of the following with FUEL released by the HUB unless 
and until that FUEL contacts anything else besides that ROBOT or FUEL CONTROLLED by that ROBOT: 
A. gain greater than MOMENTARY CONTROL of FUEL, or  
B. push or redirect FUEL to a desired location or in a preferred direction. 
A ROBOT is in CONTROL of a SCORING ELEMENT if the SCORING ELEMENT is fully supported by or 
stuck in, on, or under the ROBOT.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL. If strategic, MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD. 
Examples of interaction with a SCORING ELEMENT that are not “CONTROL” 
include, but are not limited to: 
A. “bulldozing” (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in the path 
of the ROBOT moving about the FIELD), 
B. “deflecting” (being hit by a SCORING ELEMENT that bounces off a ROBOT 
and moves in a random direction.)  
Examples of interaction which would be considered strategic include, but are not 
limited to: 
C. intentionally sitting under the HUB to collect a large quantity of FUEL, 
D. intentionally sitting under the HUB in order to redirect FUEL into your 
ALLIANCE ZONE.  
7.4.3 ROBOT 
G409 *ROBOTS must be safe. A ROBOT may not pose an undue hazard to a human, an ARENA element, or 
another ROBOT in the following ways: 

---


## Page 64

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 64 of 162 
A. the ROBOT or anything it CONTROLS, e.g. FUEL, contacts anything outside the FIELD except for 
MOMENTARY contact inside the CHUTE and/or the CORRAL,  
B. its BUMPERS fail such that a segment completely detaches,  
C. a corner of its ROBOT PERIMETER is exposed,  
D. its team number or ALLIANCE color are indeterminate,  
E. its BUMPERS leave the BUMPER ZONE (see R405) REPEATEDLY or for more than a 
MOMENTARY amount of time, or 
F. its operation or design is dangerous or unsafe. 
Violation: DISABLED. Corrective action (such as repair of BUMPERS, removing the unsafe MECHANISM, 
and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in subsequent 
MATCHES. 
Examples of dangerous operation or designs that likely pose undue hazards 
include, but are not limited to: 
A. uncontrolled motion that cannot be stopped by the DRIVE TEAM, 
B. ROBOT parts “flailing” outside of the FIELD, 
C. ROBOTS dragging their battery, and 
D. ROBOTS that consistently extend outside the FIELD. 
Please be conscious of REFEREES and FIELD STAFF working around the ARENA 
who may be in close proximity to your ROBOT. 
G410 *Keep your BUMPERS low. ROBOT extensions may not interact with the carpet, BUMPS, or TOWER 
BASE such that the BUMPERS are lifted out of the BUMPER ZONE (see R405). 
Violation: MINOR FOUL. Corrective action (such as removing the offending MECHANISM, and/or re-
inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in subsequent MATCHES. 
G411 Don’t damage the FIELD. A ROBOT may not damage FIELD elements. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. If the Head REFEREE infers that additional damage is likely, DISABLED. 
YELLOW CARD for any subsequent damage during the event. 
Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-
inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in subsequent MATCHES. 
G412 Watch your FIELD interaction. A ROBOT is prohibited from the following interactions with FIELD 
elements (with the exception of the RUNGS and UPRIGHTS): 
A. grabbing, 
B. grasping, 
C. attaching to (including the use of a vacuum or hook fastener to anchor to the FIELD carpet), 
D. becoming entangled with, and 
E. suspending from.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL, plus YELLOW CARD if REPEATED, or longer than MOMENTARY. If the Head 
REFEREE infers that damage is likely, DISABLED. Corrective action (such as removing the offending 
MECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in 
subsequent MATCHES.

G413 Expansion limits. A ROBOT may not extend beyond any of the horizontal or vertical expansion limits 
described in R105, R106, and R107. 
If the over-expansion is due to damage and not used for strategic benefit, it is an exception to this rule, 
and no penalty is imposed. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL, or MAJOR FOUL if the over-expansion is used for strategic benefit, including if it 
impedes or enables a scoring action. Corrective action (such as removing the offending MECHANISM, 
and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in subsequent 
MATCHES. 
The intent of the exception to this rule is to prevent piling on a punitive response 
to a ROBOT that’s already experienced hardship and not leveraging that hardship 
for gain. Examples for this rule include the following:  
A. a physical device on a team’s ROBOT, whose purpose is to restrain their 
TOWER mechanism from extending beyond the limit, breaks after a collision 
with another ROBOT. Provided the ROBOT does not use the now-too-long 
extension to climb the TOWER, no violation is assigned.  
B. a vertical structural member of a ROBOT breaks at the bottom and rotates 
out such that it exceeds the limit imposed. The ROBOT then parks such that 
its extension blocks opponent ROBOTS from reaching the OUTPOST. A 
MAJOR FOUL is issued.  
G414 Don’t Climb on each other. ROBOTS may not fully support the weight of other ROBOTS on their 
ALLIANCE to climb the TOWER. 
Violation: Supported ROBOTS become ineligible for TOWER points for the remainder of the MATCH. 
7.4.4 Opponent Interaction 
Note, G415, G416, G417 are mutually exclusive. A single ROBOT to ROBOT interaction which violates more 
than 1 of these rules results in the most punitive penalty, and only the most punitive penalty, being assessed. 
G415 *Stay out of other ROBOTS. A ROBOT may not use a COMPONENT outside its ROBOT PERIMETER 
(except its BUMPERS) to initiate contact with an opponent ROBOT inside the vertical projection of the 
opponent’s ROBOT PERIMETER.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL. 
For the purposes of this rule, “initiate contact” requires movement towards an 
opponent ROBOT.  
In a collision, it’s possible for both ROBOTS to initiate contact. 
G416 *This isn’t combat robotics. A ROBOT may not damage or functionally impair an opponent ROBOT in 
either of the following ways: 
A. deliberately. 
B. regardless of intent, by initiating contact, either directly or transitively via a SCORING ELEMENT 
CONTROLLED by the ROBOT, inside the vertical projection of an opponent’s ROBOT PERIMETER.

Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 66 of 162 
Damage or functional impairment because of contact with a tipped-over opponent ROBOT, which is not 
perceived by a REFEREE to be deliberate, is not a violation of this rule. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if opponent ROBOT is unable to drive, then MAJOR FOUL 
and RED CARD. 
FIRST Robotics Competition can be a full-contact competition and may include 
rigorous game play. While this rule aims to limit severe damage to ROBOTS, 
teams should design their ROBOTS to be robust. 
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to: 
A. A ROBOT leaves an arm extended, spins around to change course, and 
unintentionally hits and damages a COMPONENT inside the ROBOT 
PERIMETER of a nearby opponent ROBOT. 
B. A ROBOT, in the process of trying to quickly reverse direction, tips up on a 
single pair of wheels, lands atop an opponent ROBOT, and damages a 
COMPONENT inside that opponent’s ROBOT PERIMETER. 
C. A ROBOT high-speed rams and/or REPEATEDLY smashes an opponent 
ROBOT and causes damage. The REFEREE infers that the ROBOT was 
deliberately trying to damage the opponent’s ROBOT. 
Examples of functionally impairing another ROBOT include, but are not limited to: 
D. opening an opponent’s relief valve such that the opponent’s air pressure 
drops and 
E. powering off an opponent’s ROBOT (this example also clearly results in a RED 
CARD because the ROBOT is no longer able to drive). 
At the conclusion of the MATCH, the Head REFEREE may elect to visually inspect 
a ROBOT to confirm violations of this rule made during a MATCH and remove the 
violation if the damage cannot be verified. 
For the purposes of this rule, “initiating contact” requires movement towards an 
opponent ROBOT.  
In a collision, it’s possible for both ROBOTS to initiate contact. 
"Unable to drive" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can no longer 
drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a 
ROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the ROBOT 
is considered unable to drive. 
G417 *Don’t tip or entangle. A ROBOT may not deliberately, attach to, tip, or entangle with an opponent 
ROBOT.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if CONTINUOUS or opponent ROBOT is unable to drive, 
then MAJOR FOUL and RED CARD.  
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to: 
A. using a wedge-like MECHANISM to tip over opponent ROBOTS,

Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 67 of 162 
B. making BUMPER-to-BUMPER contact with an opponent ROBOT that is 
attempting to right itself after previously falling over and causing them to fall 
over again, and  
C. causing an opponent ROBOT to tip over by contacting the ROBOT after it 
starts to tip if, in the judgement of the REFEREE, that contact could have been 
avoided. 
Tipping as an unintended consequence of normal ROBOT to ROBOT interaction, 
including single BUMPER to BUMPER hits that result in a ROBOT tipping, is not a 
violation of this rule. 
"Unable to drive" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can no longer 
drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a 
ROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the ROBOT 
is considered unable to drive. 
G418 *There’s a 3-count on PINS. A ROBOT may not PIN an opponent’s ROBOT for more than 3 seconds. A 
ROBOT is PINNING if it is preventing the movement of an opponent ROBOT by contact, either direct or 
transitive (such as against a FIELD element). A PIN count ends once any of the following criteria below 
are met:  
A. the ROBOTS have separated by at least 72.0in (1.83m) from each other for more than 3 
seconds, 
B. either ROBOT has moved 72.0in (1.83m) from where the PIN initiated for more than 3 seconds, 
or 
C. the PINNING ROBOT gets PINNED.  
For criteria A, the PIN count pauses once ROBOTS are separated by 72.0in (1.83m) until either the PIN 
ends or the PINNING ROBOT moves back within 72.0in (1.83m), at which point the PIN count is 
resumed.  
For criteria B, the PIN count pauses once either ROBOT has moved 72.0in (1.83m)  from where the PIN 
initiated until the PIN ends or until both ROBOTS move back within 72.0in (1.83m), at which point the 
PIN count is resumed. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is 
assessed. 
A team’s desired direction of travel is not a consideration when determining if a 
ROBOT is PINNED.

Section 7 Game Rules (G) V0 - Kickoff 68 of 162 
G419 *Don’t collude with your partners to shut down major parts of game play. 2 or more ROBOTS that 
appear to a REFEREE to be working together may not isolate or close off any major element of MATCH 
play.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is 
assessed. 
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:  
A. shutting down access to all SCORING ELEMENTS,   
B. quarantining all opponents to a small area of the FIELD,  
C. preventing access to the opponent’s TOWER, 
D. preventing access to a field zone by blocking both TRENCHES, and  
E. preventing access to a field zone by blocking both BUMPS. 
Examples of standard gameplay that are not violations, include, but are not 
limited to: 
F. A single ROBOT blocking access to a particular area of the FIELD, and 
G. 2 ROBOTS independently collecting SCORING ELEMENTS in front of a BUMP 
or TRENCH at the same time. 
G420 TOWER protection. A ROBOT may not contact, directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT, an 
opponent ROBOT in contact with an opponent TOWER during the last 30 seconds of the MATCH 
regardless of who initiates contact.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and if the opponent ROBOT is off the ground the opponent ROBOT is awarded 
LEVEL 3 TOWER points.  
Transitive contact requires that each robot is contacting the same SCORING 
ELEMENT(S) simultaneously. 
7.4.5 Human 
G421 *No wandering. A DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their designated area as follows:  
A. DRIVERS and DRIVE COACHES may not contact anything outside their ALLIANCE AREA, 
B. a DRIVER must use the OPERATOR CONSOLE in the DRIVER STATION to which they are 
assigned, as indicated on the team sign,  
C. a HUMAN PLAYER may not contact anything outside their ALLIANCE AREA, and  
D. a TECHNICIAN may not contact anything outside their designated area.  
Exceptions are granted as follows:  
E. for a HUMAN PLAYER partially outside the ALLIANCE AREA,  
F. in cases concerning safety, and  
G. for actions that are inadvertent, MOMENTARY, and inconsequential. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL. 
An intent of item B is to prevent unsafe situations where long tethers to 
OPERATOR CONSOLE devices increase tripping hazards as the operator moves 
about the ALLIANCE AREA. In the interest of avoiding nuisance penalties

associated with a DRIVE TEAM member stepping outside of a prescribed area, 
we prefer to offer a general guideline as to what it means to use the OPERATOR 
CONSOLE in the ALLIANCE AREA. Provided the DRIVE TEAM member is within 
close proximity of their DRIVER STATION, there will be no repercussions. 
However, a DRIVE TEAM member located more than approximately half a 
DRIVER STATION width away from their own DRIVER STATION while using their 
OPERATOR CONSOLE is likely violating this rule. 
G422 *DRIVE COACHES and other teams: hands off the controls. A ROBOT shall be operated only by the 
DRIVERS and/or HUMAN PLAYERS of that team. A DRIVE COACH activating their E-Stop or A-Stop is 
the exception to this rule. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. RED CARD if greater-than-MOMENTARY. 
Exceptions may be made before a MATCH for major conflicts, e.g. religious 
holidays, major testing, transportations issues, etc. 
G423 *DRIVE TEAMS, watch your reach. A DRIVE TEAM member may not extend: 
A. into the CHUTE beyond the ALLIANCE-colored tape line while the CHUTE DOOR is open, or 
B. into the CORRAL beyond the ALLIANCE-colored tape line.   
Violation: MINOR FOUL.  
Teams should be careful when placing or collecting SCORING ELEMENTS and be 
aware of G101. 
G424 *Humans: use SCORING ELEMENTS as directed. A DRIVE TEAM member may not deliberately use a 
SCORING ELEMENT in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with a FIELD element.   
Violation: MAJOR FOUL.  
An example of a violation of this rule is if a HUMAN PLAYER uses a FUEL to 
disrupt an opponent ROBOT attempting to climb on the TOWER. 
G425 *SCORING ELEMENT delivery. FUEL may only be introduced to the FIELD by a HUMAN PLAYER or 
DRIVER in the following ways: 
A. through the CHUTE,  
B. through the bottom opening in the OUTPOST, or  
C. thrown from the OUTPOST AREA. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL.  
G426 *DRIVE COACHES, SCORING ELEMENTS are off limits. DRIVE COACHES may not touch SCORING 
ELEMENTS, unless for safety purposes. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL.

G427 The OUTPOST has a storage limit. Off-FIELD FUEL may only be stored in the CHUTE and the CORRAL. 
Excess FUEL, defined as the CHUTE & CORRAL being full, must immediately be entered onto the FIELD. 
HUMAN PLAYERS making a good-faith effort to immediately move or enter additional FUEL is an 
exception to this rule.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL, and if CONTINUOUS, a MAJOR FOUL is assessed. 
7.5 Post-MATCH 
G501 *Leave promptly. A DRIVE TEAM member may not cause significant or multiple delays to the start of a 
subsequent MATCH, scheduled break content, or other FIELD activities. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations at any point during the event.
