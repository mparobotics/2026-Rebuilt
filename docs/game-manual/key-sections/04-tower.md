5.6 TRENCH 
Figure 5-10: TRENCH 
 
TRENCHES are a 65.65in (1.668m) wide, 47.0in (1.194m) deep, and 40.25in (1.022m) tall structure that 
ROBOTS drive underneath. The TRENCH extends from the guardrail to the BUMP on both sides of the FIELD. 
The space underneath each TRENCH arm is 50.34in (1.279m) wide, 22.25in (56.52cm) tall.  
TRENCHES along the guardrail closest to the scoring table contain additional electronics to reach the HUB. 
The TRENCHES along the guardrail furthest from the scoring table have a pivot arm that allows the horizontal 
portion of the TRENCH to rotate into a vertical position for post-MATCH ROBOT retrieval and to let FIELD staff 
reset the field between matches. The pivot arm will be locked in the horizontal position during the MATCH. 
5.7 DEPOT 
Figure 5-11: DEPOT 
 
A DEPOT is a 42.0in (1.07m) wide, 27.0in (68.6cm) deep structure located along the ALLIANCE WALL. There is 
1 DEPOT per ALLIANCE. DEPOTS are made up of 3.0in (7.62cm) wide, 1.0in (2.54) tall steel barriers. The 
DEPOT is secured to the carpet using hook fastener which increases the height to approximately 1.125in 
(2.86cm).

5.8 TOWER 
Figure 5-12: TOWER 
 
A TOWER is a 49.25in (1.251m) wide, 45.0in (1.143m) deep, and 78.25in (1.988m) tall structure made up of the 
TOWER WALL, TOWER BASE, UPRIGHTS, RUNGS and supporting structures. There is 1 TOWER per ALLIANCE. 
A TOWER is integrated into each ALLIANCE WALL between DRIVER STATION 2 and DRIVER STATION 3. 
The TOWER BASE is a 39.0in (99.06cm) wide by 45.18in (1.148m) deep plate that sits on the floor and extends 
from the TOWER WALL. The TOWER BASE is powder-coated steel with hook fastener underneath. The edges 
of the TOWER BASE are approximately 0.2in (0.5cm) to 0.3in (0.8cm) tall. 
The UPRIGHTS are two 72.1in (1.831m) tall, 1.5in (3.81cm) thick, 3.5in (8.89cm) deep sheet metal box frames 
that extend vertically up from the TOWER BASE. The distance between each UPRIGHT is 32.25in (81.92cm). 
The UPRIGHTS hold three horizontal RUNGS made up of 1-1/4in Sch 40 (1.66in (4.216cm) OD) pipe. Each 
RUNG is centered between the UPRIGHT and extend 5.875in (14.92cm) from the outer face of the UPRIGHT on 
either side. The center of the LOW RUNG is located 27.0in (68.58cm) from the floor. The center of the MID 
RUNG is located 45.0in (114.3cm) from the floor. The center of the HIGH RUNG is 63.0in (1.6m) from the floor. 
The RUNGS are 18.0in (45.72cm) apart center to center. 
The UPRIGHTS and RUNGS are powder-coated red or blue. 
Each TOWER has additional supporting structures extending from the UPRIGHT to the TOWER WALL between 
approximately 28.40in (72.14cm) and 43.38in (1.102m) off the floor.

5.9.1 DRIVER STATIONS 
Figure 5-15: DRIVER STATION (ALLIANCE AREA perspective and FIELD perspective) 
 
A DRIVER STATION is 1 of 3 assemblies within an ALLIANCE WALL behind which a DRIVE TEAM operates their 
ROBOT. Each DRIVER STATION is made from a 36.8in (93.5cm) tall diamond plate base topped with a 42in 
(1.07m) tall transparent plastic sheet and a top rail.  
An aluminum shelf is attached to each DRIVER STATION to support an OPERATOR CONSOLE. The shelf is 69in 
(1.75m) wide and 12.25in (31.1cm) deep. There is a 54.0in (1.372m) long by 2.0in (nominal) wide strip of hook-
and-loop tape (“loop” side) along the center of the support shelf that may be used to secure the OPERATOR 
CONSOLE to the shelf. The shelf also includes two clips to hold the shelf in place with a 1.0in (2.5cm) wide by 
2.0in (5.1cm) deep tab that sits on the top surface of the shelf. 
There is a 6.0in (15.2cm) tall sponsor panel in each DRIVER STATION. The top of this panel is 42.9in (1.09m) 
from the carpet. 
There may be a ramp available at events for DRIVE TEAMS with limited mobility. 
It is designed to allow an individual using a wheelchair to access the DRIVER 
STATION shelf and/or see onto the FIELD; however, this accommodation is 
available to anyone who has a wheelchair or other physical disability that 
obstructs their view of the FIELD. Teams should speak to the FTA before 
MATCHES begin to ensure that it is available for each of the team’s MATCHES.  
This ramp is available at many Regional and District events. For questions, 
please connect with the local Program Delivery Partner. 
Teams should also speak to the FTA for any other FIELD side accommodations 
needed.
