5 ARENA   
The ARENA includes all elements of the game infrastructure that are required to play REBUILTTM presented by 
Haas: the FIELD, SCORING ELEMENTS, queue area, team media area (when available), designated 
TECHNICIAN area, and all equipment needed for FIELD control, ROBOT control, and scorekeeping. 
Figure 5-1 REBUILT ARENA (queue area, TECHNICIAN area, and media area not pictured) 
 
5.1 Dimensions and Accuracy 
All official models for the REBUILT FIELD were created in Onshape.  
 
The specification for the REBUILT FIELD can be retrieved from a few locations: 
− The 3D CAD model is the official representation of the REBUILT FIELD and how it is constructed. 
− Illustrations included in this section are for a general visual understanding of the REBUILT ARENA, 
and dimensions included in the manual are nominal and no tolerances are implied. Please refer to 
the official drawings for exact dimensions, tolerances, and construction details. 
− The Field Dimension Drawings package has critical dimensions for each FIELD element. 
− The FIELD Manual (coming soon) includes instructions on how to build the FIELD along with 
showing the ways construction type will influence the field tolerances. It also includes many of the 
key dimensions which are listed in the Official FIELD Drawings. 
− The FIELD Acceptance Checklist (coming soon) includes the controlled dimensions (with relevant 
tolerances) which will be checked by event staff a few times throughout the event. The FIELD is 
expected to change during MATCH play. Teams can ask the FTA to re-check specific 
measurements if they believe something is out of spec prior to a MATCH beginning.

The official drawings, CAD models, and drawings for low-cost versions of important elements of the REBUILT 
FIELD are posted on the Playing FIELD webpage. 
The ARENA is modular and assembled, used, disassembled, and shipped many 
times during the competition season. It undergoes wear and tear. The ARENA is 
designed to withstand rigorous play and frequent shipping. Every effort is made 
to ensure that ARENAS are consistent from event to event.  
However, ARENAS are assembled in different venues by different event staff and 
some small variations occur. Successful teams will design ROBOTS that are 
insensitive to these variations. 
5.2 FIELD 
Each FIELD for REBUILT is an approximately 317.7in (~8.07m) by 651.2in (~16.54m) carpeted area bounded 
by inward facing surfaces of the ALLIANCE WALLS, OUTPOSTS, TOWER WALLS, and guardrails. 
Figure 5-2 FIELD boundary in pink 
 
 
The FIELD is populated with and surrounded by the following elements:  
− 1 OUTPOST per ALLIANCE,  
− 1 HUB per ALLIANCE, 
− 1 TOWER per ALLIANCE, 
− 2 DEPOTS,  
− 4 BUMPS, and 
− 4 TRENCHES.

The surface of the FIELD is low pile carpet, Shaw Floors, Philadelphia Commercial, Neyland II 20, “66561 
Medallion.” Neyland II carpet is not available for purchase at this time, and the closest equivalent is Shaw, 
Philadelphia Brand, Profusion 20, Style 54933; see results from evaluation in this blog post. 
Carpet edges and seams are secured with 3MTM Premium Matte Cloth (Gaffers) Tape GT2, GT3 or comparable 
Gaffer’s Tape. Tears, rips, and damage to the carpet may be repaired with the same styles of tape and ROBOTS 
must be prepared to operate on surfaces made of carpet, tape, or combinations of both materials as repairs 
are made through the course of competition. 
Guardrails form the long edges of the FIELD. Guardrails are a 20.0in (50.8cm) tall system of transparent 
polycarbonate supported on the top and bottom by aluminum extrusion. There are 4 gates in the guardrail that 
allow access to the FIELD for placement and removal of ROBOTS. The gate passthrough, when open, is 38.0in 
(96.5cm) wide. Gates are closed and shielded during the MATCH.  
Figure 5-3 Gate locations 
 
There are 2 versions of guardrails and DRIVER STATIONS used for competitions. 1 design is the Welded FIELD 
which is reflected in the 2026 Official FIRST FIELD Drawings & Models. The other is designed and sold by 
AndyMark. Table 5-1 and  
Table 5-2 illustrate which areas have each kind of FIELD. While the designs are slightly different, the critical 
dimensions, performance, and expected user experience between them are the same unless otherwise noted. 
Detailed drawings for the AndyMark design are posted on the AndyMark website. All illustrations in this 
manual show the traditional Welded FIELD design.
