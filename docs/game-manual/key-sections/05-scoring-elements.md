5.9.2 OUTPOST 
Figure 5-19 OUTPOST 
 
An OUTPOST is an assembly through which HUMAN PLAYERS feed FUEL into the FIELD and ROBOTS can 
deliver FUEL to their HUMAN PLAYERS. There are 2 OUTPOSTS, 1 on either end of the FIELD connecting the 
guardrail to the ALLIANCE WALL. Each OUTPOST has a 31.8in (80.8cm) wide by 7.0in (17.8cm) tall opening 
through which FUEL passes to the FIELD. The bottom of the opening is 28.1in (71.4cm) off the floor.  
A 15.0° sloped tunnel, called the CHUTE, leads to the upper opening in the OUTPOST. The CHUTE can hold 
approximately 25 FUEL at a time retained by the CHUTE DOOR. The CHUTE DOOR is an HDPE arm on a pivot 
that can be rotated approximately 90 degrees by the HUMAN PLAYER to open or close the CHUTE. 
At the base of the OUTPOST is an opening 32.0in (81.3cm) wide by 7.0in (17.8cm) tall where ROBOTS can 
push FUEL into the CORRAL. The bottom of the opening is 1.88in (4.77cm) off the ground. The opening is 
divided in the center by a vertical 1-1/4in Sch 40 (1.66in (4.216cm) OD) pipe. The CORRAL is made up of 8.13in 
(20.6cm) tall polycarbonate panels that create a 35.8in (90.8cm) wide, 37.6in (95.5cm) deep area on the floor 
in which FUEL can be stored.  
The CHUTE and CORRAL each feature an ALLIANCE-colored tape line that indicates where DRIVE TEAMS may 
be restricted from reaching. The near edge of the CORRAL tape is 12.7in (32.3cm) from the FIELD-facing wall 
of the OUTPOST. The near edge of the CHUTE tape line is 12.9in (32.8cm) from the FIELD-facing wall of the 
OUTPOST. 
There are 2 stools available at events for DRIVE TEAMS to use. Each stool is 
23.0in (58.42cm) wide by 13.5in (34.29cm) deep, 6.25in (15.88cm) tall, and rated 
for 300lb (136.0kg). 
It is specially intended to allow individuals who are shorter, better sightlines onto 
the FIELD; however, this accommodation is available to anyone who has another 
physical disability that obstructs their view of the FIELD.

Only 2 stools are available, and priority will be given to those with the biggest 
need. Teams should speak to the FTA before MATCHES begin to request that it 
is available for each of the team’s MATCHES. Teams may also purchase their 
own (Item Number: 779ac01stpm) or bring an equivalent (e.g. not foldable and 
similar dimensions) version to the event to guarantee use for every match.  
This stool is available at all events within the US & Canada and equivalents are 
available at international events. For questions, please connect with the local 
Program Delivery Partner. 
5.10 SCORING ELEMENTS 
SCORING ELEMENTS are items that teams use to score points. There is one type of SCORING ELEMENT used 
in REBUILT: FUEL.  
In REBUILT, a ROBOT may CONTROL any number of SCORING ELEMENTS after 
the start of the MATCH. 
5.10.1 FUEL 
Figure 5-20 FUEL 
 
A FUEL is a 5.91in (15.0cm) diameter, high density foam ball. FUEL is a custom made SCORING ELEMENT 
available for purchase on the AndyMark website, am-5801. 
FUEL has a weight of between 0.448-0.500lb (~0.203-0.227kg).  
FUEL undergoes wear and tear during a competition. Generally, a FUEL that still appears to look approximately 
like a FUEL is considered a FUEL for the purposes of rule evaluation and scoring, whether damaged or not. 
Small chunks of a FUEL are not considered a FUEL. 
Most new FUEL will have small impressions due to being pressed against other 
FUEL or the sides of the packaging during shipping. These impressions are 
purely cosmetic and do not affect the function of the FUEL. Most impressions 
will gradually disappear as the FUEL is used.

5.11 AprilTags 
AprilTags are 8.125in (20.64cm) square targets located on the HUB, TOWER WALL, OUTPOST, and TRENCHES. 
There are 32 unique markers on the FIELD positioned as shown in Figure 5-21. 
Figure 5-21 AprilTag Locations 
 
All markers are from the 36h11 tag family, IDs 1-32. All AprilTags are mounted to and centered on a 10.5in 
(26.67cm) square polycarbonate panel. Each marker has an identifying text label. If AprilTags experience wear 
and marking during MATCHES they are repaired with gaffers tape.
