Figure 6-1 REBUILT 
 
In REBUILT, 2 ALLIANCES (an ALLIANCE is a cooperative of up to 4 FIRST Robotics Competition teams) play 
MATCHES, set up and implemented per the details described below.  
6.1 MATCH Overview 
MATCHES run on 7–10-minute cycles, which consist of pre-MATCH setup, the 2-minute and 40-second 
MATCH, and the post-MATCH reset. 
During the MATCH, ROBOTS collect FUEL and score in their HUB. HUMAN PLAYERS can deliver FUEL to 
ROBOTS or score them in their HUB.  
ROBOTS conclude the MATCH climbing on their TOWER. 
6.2 DRIVE TEAM 
A DRIVE TEAM is a set of up to 5 people from the same FIRST Robotics Competition team responsible for 
team performance for a specific MATCH. There are 4 specific roles on a DRIVE TEAM which ALLIANCES can 
use to assist ROBOTS, and no more than 1 member of the DRIVE TEAM may be a non-STUDENT.  
The intent of the definition of DRIVE TEAM and DRIVE TEAM related rules is that, 
barring extenuating circumstances, the DRIVE TEAM consists of people who 
arrived at the event affiliated with that team and are responsible for their team’s 
and ROBOT’S performance at the event (this means a person may be affiliated 
with more than 1 team).  
The intent is not to allow teams to “adopt” members of other teams for strategic 
advantage for the loaning team, borrowing team, and/or their ALLIANCE (e.g. an 
ALLIANCE CAPTAIN believes 1 of their DRIVERS has more experience than a 
DRIVER on their first pick, and the teams agree the first pick team will “adopt” 
that DRIVER and make them a member of their DRIVE TEAM for Playoffs).

The definition isn’t stricter for 2 main reasons. First, to avoid additional 
bureaucratic burden on teams and event volunteers (e.g. requiring that teams 
submit official rosters that Queuing must check before allowing a DRIVE TEAM 
into the ARENA). Second, to provide space for exceptional circumstances that 
give teams the opportunity to display Gracious Professionalism (e.g. a bus is 
delayed, a DRIVE COACH has no DRIVERS, and their pit neighbors agree to help 
by loaning DRIVERS as temporary members of the team until their bus arrives). 
Table 6-1 DRIVE TEAM roles 
Role Description Max./ 
DRIVE TEAM 
Criteria 
DRIVE COACH a guide or advisor  1 any team member, must wear “DRIVE 
COACH” button 
TECHNICIAN a resource for ROBOT 
troubleshooting, setup, and 
removal from the FIELD 
1 any team member, must wear 
“TECHNICIAN” button 
DRIVER an operator and controller 
of the ROBOT  
3 STUDENT, must wear a “DRIVE TEAM” 
button 
HUMAN PLAYER a SCORING ELEMENT 
manager 
A STUDENT is a person who has not completed high-school, secondary school, or the comparable level as of 
September 1 prior to Kickoff.  
The TECHNICIAN provides teams with a technical resource for pre-MATCH setup, ROBOT connectivity, 
OPERATOR CONSOLE troubleshooting, and post-MATCH removal of the ROBOT. Some pre-MATCH 
responsibilities for the TECHNICIAN may include, but are not limited to: 
− location of the ROBOT radio, its power connection, and understanding of its indicator lights 
− location of the roboRIO and understanding of its indicator lights 
− username and password for the OPERATOR CONSOLE 
− restarting the Driver Station and Dashboard software on the OPERATOR CONSOLE 
− changing the bandwidth utilization (e.g. camera resolution, frame rate, etc.) 
− changing a battery 
− charging pneumatics 
While the TECHNICIAN may be the primary technical member of the DRIVE 
TEAM, all members of the DRIVE TEAM are encouraged to have knowledge of the 
basic functionality of the ROBOT, such as the location and operation of the main 
circuit breaker, connecting and resetting joysticks or gamepads from the 
OPERATOR CONSOLE, and removing the ROBOT from the FIELD. 
Per Table 6-1, each team is allotted up to 3 STUDENTS who may be assigned as DRIVERS or HUMAN 
PLAYERS. If multiple teams on an ALLIANCE do not have 3 STUDENTS at the event to act in these roles, 1 of

the ALLIANCE’S teams may substitute a STUDENT TECHNICIAN as a HUMAN PLAYER for that MATCH only. In 
this case,  
− the Head REFEREE must be notified,  
− all HUMAN PLAYER rules now apply to this DRIVE TEAM member, and  
− this DRIVE TEAM member is no longer considered a TECHNICIAN for that MATCH. 
6.3 Setup 
Before each MATCH begins, FIELD STAFF stage SCORING ELEMENTS as described in section 6.3.4 SCORING 
ELEMENTS. DRIVE TEAMS stage their ROBOTS (as described in section 6.3.3 ROBOTS) and OPERATOR 
CONSOLES (as described in section 6.3.2 OPERATOR CONSOLES). Then, DRIVE TEAMS take their places as 
described in section 6.3.1 DRIVE TEAMS. 
6.3.1 DRIVE TEAMS  
DRIVE TEAMS prepare for a MATCH by staging in the appropriate areas, according to their role on the DRIVE 
TEAM, and by identifying themselves accordingly. DRIVE TEAM starting conditions are listed below, and a 
DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying any of the conditions is at risk of violating G301. 
A. only DRIVE TEAM members assigned to the upcoming MATCH are present, 
B. for Qualification MATCHES only DRIVE TEAM members whose ROBOTS have passed initial, complete 
Inspection are present,  
C. any number of HUMAN PLAYERS are staged in their OUTPOST AREAS, 
D. HUMAN PLAYERS not included in C, DRIVERS, and DRIVE COACHES are in their ALLIANCE AREA and 
behind the HUMAN STARTING LINE, 
E. TECHNICIANS are in the event-designated area near the FIELD, 
F. DRIVE TEAM members clearly display their designated buttons above their waists (DRIVE COACH - 
“Drive Coach”, DRIVERS and HUMAN PLAYERS - “Drive Team”, and TECHNICIAN - “Technician”), and 
G. if a Playoff MATCH, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN clearly displays their designated ALLIANCE CAPTAIN 
identifier (e.g. hat or armband). 
6.3.2 OPERATOR CONSOLES 
DRIVE TEAMS set up their OPERATOR CONSOLE as soon as the DRIVE TEAM from the previous MATCH has 
cleared the area. OPERATOR CONSOLES must be compliant with all relevant rules, specifically those in section 
8.9 OPERATOR CONSOLE. The OPERATOR CONSOLE is plugged into the team’s assigned DRIVER STATION, as 
indicated on the team sign. Any control devices worn or held by their HUMAN PLAYERS and/or DRIVERS during 
the MATCH must be disconnected from or set on or beside the OPERATOR CONSOLE before the MATCH can 
begin. A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying OPERATOR CONSOLE setup is at risk of violating G301. 
For the purposes of FIRST Robotics Competition, any device connected to the 
OPERATOR CONSOLE is considered a control device because REFEREES are not 
expected to differentiate between devices that can or cannot control the ROBOT.
